<h1>Puzzle #74 - Canceling Navigation</h1>

<p>This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with Global Server interactivity.</p>
<p>When the user navigates away from this page, we want to be notified and also be able to cancel the navigation.</p>
<p>You might need this if, for example, the user is adding a new record. 
    You could ask the user to confirm whether they really want to navigate away from the page before saving.</p>
<p>We know we need a Navigation Manager, but how can we use it to cancel the navigation?</p>
<p>The solution is to call RegisterLocationChangingHandler passing a delegate. 
    In that handler method, we can call PreventNavigation(). 
</p>

@code {

    private IDisposable? navigationHandler;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        navigationHandler = navigationManager.RegisterLocationChangingHandler(OnLocationChanging);
    }

    private async ValueTask OnLocationChanging(LocationChangingContext context)
    {
        // Example: show a confirmation dialog
        var shouldLeave = await jsRuntime.InvokeAsync<bool>("confirm", "You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?");
        if (!shouldLeave)
        {
            context.PreventNavigation(); // Cancels the navigation
        }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Unsubscribe from the handler when the component is disposed
        navigationHandler?.Dispose();
    }
}
